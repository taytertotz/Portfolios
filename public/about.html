<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Tayte Deom, I am sort of new to the whole IT scheme of things but I find my passion lies within. I have
my SEC+ which I obtained through an online course through Comptia last year. I am already learning so much and realizing
that there are so many more things to learn. I am looking forward to the challenge that awaits me as I go deeper into the
code and developing aspects that the web developer course that I am currently taking has to offer. </p>

<p>I was born in Illinois and had been moved around my whole childhood as my dad was in the military, I'm proud to say that
I have been living in New York all the way from early middle school, to being graduated, and still choosing to stay in New York
for many reasons, family, Church, and the friendships I have made while calling this state my home. </p>

<p>As for my goals I have for my future, I would have to say I have quite a few in mind. First to keep God first above all else
I know sometimes it's difficult with the day to day challenges that arise but I find it very important to keep Him first priority. 
I would like to definitely find a position within the IT field I may not have the skills at the moment to be of much help, however 
I am a quick learner and am motivated to secure myself a position whenever the opportunity arises. Last but not least, I want to 
raise a family of my own. I think we all have had at least the same dream of growing up and instilling what values or lessons we
wish we had been given as kids into children of our own.</p>
